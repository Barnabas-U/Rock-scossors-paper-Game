## My process 
This is a one page project. so first I built,styled the rules page, & built the cancel button of the rules. I used /.style.display = "none"/ to make the rules dissapear when the x(cancel) button is clicked.

Then I built & styled the selection page. I built a function that makes the selected hand appear on the next page as my picked hand. and another function to randomly select a hand for the house and display said selected hand on the next page as "the house picked" hand, right as I select mine. and a third function that determines who wins the round and displays it, while also adding or subtracting a new score and display it on the score board.

I also built a function that takes the game back to the selection page with just a click of a button. finaly, I built a button that displays the rules once again.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Since I learnt data structures, I havn't had a reason to use /Math.random()/ until now. with this project, I was able to brush up on my data structures a little bit.

I also learnt to use /setTimeout()/ to delay a fucntion for however long is needed.

### Continued development

I would like to keep building more games, so I can get better with data structures.
